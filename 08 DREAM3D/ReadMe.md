# IUMAS 8 - DREAM3D-NX for Processing and Visualizing EBSDData

Please download the latest version of DREAM3D-NX from [http://www.dream3d.io](http://www.dream3d.io) which is "7.0.0-RC-3". The installation will come with the application and example data files.

I will make the presentation available after the conference for those wanting to revisit the slides.

## Repositories

The main DREAM3D-NX repository is via invitation only but the filters and core codes are kept in an open source repository at [https://www.github.com/bluequartzsoftware/complex](https://www.github.com/bluequartzsoftware/complex).


## Older Versions of DREAM.3D

If you are familiar with DREAM.3D, those repositories are still available and downloads are still available. Please note that all new development is going into the "7.0" version of DREAM.3D.
